## TROUBLESHOOTING AND KNOWN ISSUES
* Blazy and its sub-modules -- Slick, GridStack, etc. are tightly coupled.
  Be sure to have the latest release date or matching versions in the least.
  DEV for DEV, Beta for Beta, etc. Mismatched versions may lead to errors
  especially before having RCs. Mismatched branches will surely be errors.
* Resizing is not supported. Just reload the page.
* Images are gone, only eternal blue loader is flipping like a drunk butterfly.
  Solution: ensures that blazy library is loaded. And temporarily switch to
  stock Bartik themes.
* Press F12 at any browser, and see the errors at the browser console. Any JS
  error will prevent Blazy from working identified by eternal blue loaders.
* Images are collapsed. Solution: choose one of the Aspect ratio.
* Images or videos aren't responsive. Solution: choose one of the Aspect ratio.
* Images are distorted. Solution: choose the correct Aspect ratio. If unsure,
  choose "fluid" to let the module calculate aspect ratio automatically.

### 1. VIEWS INTEGRATION
Blazy provides a simple Views field for File Entity, and Media.

When using Blazy formatter within Views, check **Use field template** under
**Style settings**, if trouble with Blazy Formatter as a stand alone Views
output.

On the contrary, uncheck **Use field template**, when Blazy formatter
is embedded inside another module such as Slick so to pass the renderable
array to work with accordingly.

This is a Views common gotcha with field formatter, so be aware of it.
If confusing, just toggle **Use field template**, and see the output. You'll
know which works.


### 2. BLAZY GRID WITH SINGLE VALUE FIELD (D7 ONLY)
This is no issue at D8. Blazy Grid formatter is designed for multi-value fields.
Unfortunately no handy way to disable formatters for single value at D7. So
the formatter is available even for single value, but not actually
functioning. Please ignore it till we can get rid of it at D7, if possible,
without extra legs.

### 3. MIN-WIDTH
If the images appear to be shrink within a **floating** container, add
some expected width or min-width to the parent container via CSS accordingly.
Non-floating image parent containers aren't affected.

### 4. MIN-HEIGHT
Add a min-height CSS to individual element to avoid layout reflow if not using
**Aspect ratio** or when **Aspect ratio** is not supported such as with
Responsive image. Otherwise some collapsed image containers will defeat the
purpose of lazyloading. When using CSS background, the container may also be
collapsed.

### 5. SOLUTIONS
Both layout reflow and lazyloading delay issues are actually taken care of
if **Aspect ratio** option is enabled in the first place.

Adjust, and override blazy CSS/ JS files accordingly.

### 6. BLAZY FILTER
Blazy Filter must run after **Align/ Caption filters** as otherwise the required
CSS class `b-lazy` will be moved into `<figure>` elements and make Blazy fail
with JS error due to not finding the required `SRC` and `[data-src]` attributes.
**Align/ Caption filters** output are respected and moved into Blazy markups
accordingly when Blazy Filter runs after them.
**Note**: This is D8 only issue. However it may apply to D7 for similar filters.

### 7. INTERSECTION OBSERVER API
* **IntersectionObserver API** is not loading all images, try disabling
  **Disconnect** option at Blazy UI.
* **IntersectionObserver API** is not working with Slick `slidesToShow > 1`, try
  disabling Slick `centerMode`. If still failing, choose one of the 4 lazy
  load options, except Blazy.

### 8. BROKEN MODULES
Alpha, Beta, DEV releases are for developers only. Beware of possible breakage.

However if it is broken, unless an update is provided, running `drush cr` during
DEV releases should fix most issues as we add new services, or change things.
If you don't drush, before any module update, always open:

[Performance](/admin/config/development/performance)

And so you are ready to hit **Clear all caches** if any issue.
Only at worst case, know how to run http://dgo.to/registry_rebuild safely.
